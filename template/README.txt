Congratulations!

You now have a “Sneakernet” version of the map you attempted to upload to the
Antirubbersheeter. Because your image was so large, it made more sense just to
break it up into pieces and make it available to you as a self-contained
webpage. 

To use this, double-click on the file “index.html.” That should automatically
open in your browser, and you should see your image with the little box asking
to start geocoding. It saved the place names you typed into the
Antirubbersheeter, and you can start marking places.

When you’re done, the Antirubbersheeter will display the JSON data that
represents your dataset. You MUST copy this, because otherwise you will lose
all your work!

I recommend pasting it into the “mapdata.js” file that is also in this
package, following the directions you see there, namely replacing the first
“{” with “var mapData = {” and adding a semicolon right after the very last
“}”.

Assuming you pasted everything into “mapdata.js” correctly, you should now be
able to double-click on the file “map.html,” which will also present your map,
like you expect, but it will now have all of the markers you coded.

Cheers! Now you can bring this up whenever you want. As for putting it back on
the internet… that’s a bit beyond the scope of the Antirubbersheeter.

If you have questions, etc., don’t hesitate to reach me on twitter at
@muziejus.

Until then, happy mapping!
